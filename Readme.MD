Task: Compute the PageRank scores on the Wikipedia dataset. 
Dataset: WikiData.txt 

The format of the lines in the file is as follow: 
FromNodeID ToNodeID 

In this project, you need to report the Top 100 NodeID with their PageRank scores. You can choose different parameters, such as the teleport parameter, to compare different results. One result you must report is that when the teleport parameter is set to 0.85. 

In addition to the basic PageRank algorithm, you need to implement the Block-Stripe Update algorithm (see pages 53-59 in the ppt of class 5: Link Analysis). 

One group (consisting of at most two students) needs to write a report about this project. The report should include but not limited to the following contents: 
1.	Basic statistics of the dataset (e.g., number of nodes, number of edges, etc); 
2.	Details of the algorithm; 
3.	Experimental results of the basic PageRank algorithm and analysis; 
4.	Experimental results of the optimized PageRank (Block-Stripe Update algorithm), and the comparison with the basic version on space and time complexity with theoretical analysis or/and experimental analysis. 

Submit Content: 
(1)	Source code (C/C++/Java) 
(2)	Executable code 
(3)	Report
